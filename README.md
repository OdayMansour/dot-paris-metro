Paris Metro described in graphviz .dot

### Why did I do this?
I was working with the Paris Metro network in another project and saw that the data provided by RATP was split into data about Stations and data about Lines. 

I needed to combine both datasets in order to do some graph work and thought Graphviz .dot was the best way to describe the graph in a languages that:
- Can be rendered into a picture easily
- Is human readable
- Is easily machine parsable
